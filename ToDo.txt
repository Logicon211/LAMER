- Set up inventory screen essentials. Figure out how to get scrolling inventory

	- Add item list scrolling if the list is too large for the screen

	- Probably set up a second view in the inventory list screen to do comparisons with Current and selected items

	- May make a large array which initializes all INVENTORY items, each actual part will have a number which refers to the index of where the INVENTORY item is stored in this array.

	- Set up a bunch of fonts with colors and sizes appropriate for the inventory screen

	- Make stat screen look nicer, finish up it's layout
	
	- Gonna need to get Eliot to help me display the preview and color sliders

- Sync up with Eliot and merge code to get his object files into my version. (Sort of done?)

- Figure out a way to save and load player inventory from save file



- Decide on an array, list, or HashMap for inventory storage. Need to design some way to display it (Button bring up a UI entity?)
It will need to be able to scroll in case user has lots of items.





-------------NOTES--------------------

-"InventoryItems" Need to be persistent so they can be referenced anywhere)
- MapController kinda does more than just Map controlling stuff, it's persistent so it handles some global Controls. (Like Backing out of screens)
	-It also contains the globalvars for Player inventory and loadout.
- PlayerLoadOut is the array that containts the player's currently selected parts
